Hello everyone, my name is Zhikai Chen. Currently, I am a first-year Ph.D. student from Michigan State University, supervised by [Professor Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/). Previously, I received both of my bachelor and master degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

My research interest includes graph machine learning and large language models. Specifically, my current research is mainly about the development of **graph foundation model**. 

üíª We are hosting a workshop on graph foundation models at WWW 2024 https://www.www24gfm.com/ and look forward to your submission!
